So after a week of recovery from the wonders VeeamOn and New Orleans had for me, I thought I'd put together some brief posts to outline the major announcements that Veeam had for us at VeeamON this year.

#### **Firstly, what is VeeamON?**

VeeamON is Veeam's annual conference, coined as _The World’s Premier Availability Event._ This year the event was held at the Ernest Morial Convention Center in New Orleans.

The event features, amongst other highlights:

- 

**Keynote Speakers** - This year, [Sanjay Poonen](https://twitter.com/spoonen) (COO at VMware) and [Mark Russinovich](https://twitter.com/markrussinovich) (CTO at Microsoft Azure) took to the stage to speak about the strategic link between VMware and Veeam, and how the cloud is becoming the norm for the modern datacentre.

- 

**Breakout Sessions** - At last count, there were 85+ breakout sessions which attendees could attend, ranging from business focused discussions, all the way to technical deep dives on new and existing Veeam features

- 

**VMCE Training** - The [VMCE](https://www.veeam.com/vmce.html) (and the new [VMCE-ADO](https://www.veeam.com/vmce.html)) are Veeam's certifications which you can use to show that you, as an engineer, possess the necessary level of expertise to correctly deploy, configure and administrate all the products within the Veeam suite. This year, they had training available on site as well as a Pearson Vue test centre which enabled attendees to take the exam straight after taking the course!

- 

**Networking Opportunities** - VeeamON gives you the opportunity to expand your network, connect with IT peers, industry experts and Veeam’s top talent, and voice your opinion to help drive new Veeam innovations and support. (Oh, and not to mention the parties... Veeam know how to [party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQOXcvKduLw)!)

- 

**Hands-On Labs** - Interactive work stations will be staffed with Veeam systems engineers who are available as you drop-in throughout the conference. Hear something in a session you just have to try? Stop by the hands-on lab and attempt your new solutions. Have a challenge you haven’t quite been able to figure out? Walk through it with an engineer in the lab.

- 

**LabWarz** - Test yourself and your knowledge of Veeam! LabWarz returns to VeeamON 2017 with exciting new scenarios designed to challenge you as you compete against your peers for the fastest time. Solve the scenario with the best time and win $10,000. Not a bad pay-out for less than 45 minutes of work!

Well there you go, there's a brief overview of what VeeamON is! I'll be breaking down the highlights and releases in the next few blog posts so stay tuned and I look forward to seeing you in [Chicago for VeeamON 2018!](https://www.veeam.com/veeamon)
